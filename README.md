# Advent of Code for students 2022

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar, created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

In each folder you can find Day*XX*.md with task description, Day*XX*.txt with task input and Day*XX*_test.txt with test input,
where *XX* is each day number e.g 01, 02, 03.
